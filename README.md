This project is designed as a museum exhibit and to be ran on a touchscreen. It is designed to be set up and left for as long as the museum would like.
Developer tools are also coded within the app so that whoever downloads the program can make basic changes.

The application was developed over a 7 week project in Bucharest, Romania working with The Museum of Horrors of Communism
I was the sole technical developer on this project and had to find ways for other group members to contribute without writing code. Which was done by:
*Using CSV files to input data
*Using JSON files to input citations
*Using simple picture management approaches

A full launch was also conducted where ~90 children tested the application and gave feedback.

Feel free to reach out to me with any questions on the program.
