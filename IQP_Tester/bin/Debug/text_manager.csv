This headquarters, named ""The People's House"" was constructed on a hill and used roughly 30% of Romania's GDP and used up significant amounts of Romania's natural resources.

 The July Theses included
* More censorship of books, newspapers, TV, and movies. 
* Less freedom of speech — people were not allowed to criticize the government.
* Tighter control over education — schools had to teach communist ideas and praise the Ceaușescu family.
* More political propaganda — the media had to constantly show support for the Communist Party.
* Increased focus on nationalism — teaching that Romania was great and strong because of its leaders.
* Restrictions on Western culture — music, clothes, and ideas from other countries were discouraged or banned.

The July Theses marked the start of a harsher, more repressive period in Romania. Ceaușescu wanted to control what people thought, said, and even listened to.

"lblAnaAnsPolLong","The Romanian Communist Party was founded on May 8th, 1921 (Chicina, 2023). After World War II, the party was influenced by the Soviet Union and its leader, Joseph Stalin. The communists slowly took control by using propaganda and taking advantage of other political parties’ weaknesses (Chicina, 2023). Communism officially started in Romania in 1947, when King Michael I was forced to give up the throne and the country became a communist republic.

Ana Pauker was an intellectual and was the unofficial prime minister of Romania's communist party after WWII. She was a strong believer in Stalinist ideology, a totalitarian political regime lead by Joseph Stalin. The main policies of his regime were rapid induztrialization, cultural revoluetion, and a reorginization of agricultural output (Brown et al., 2018).

 While she supported Stalinism, she did not believe in collectivization and did allow for emigration of the Jewish population - something not seen in other communist leaders at the time. Pauker was the first woman to hold such a position in the Communist Party. In 1952, she was ousted of her position by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and was placed under arrest as a result due to the political risk she posed to Gheorghiu-Dej.","EMPTY, USING OTHER ANS",

The Securitate kept people in constant fear, and anyone who spoke out could be arrested or worse.

There were severe food and energy shortages, and people had almost no freedom of speech or movement. A powerful secret police force called the Securitate spied on citizens, creating an atmosphere of fear and mistrust. Ceaușescu also forced the country into huge construction projects, like the Palace of the Parliament in Bucharest —one of the largest buildings in the world.

"lblMarxismAnsPolLong","Marxism is a way of thinking about society, economics, and politics that was created by Karl Marx. It is the idea that society is divided into two main groups: the rich (bourgeoisie) – who own businesses, land, and factories - and the working class (proletariat) – who work for the rich but don’t own much themselves. Marx believed this wasn’t fair and believed that the workers should come together, take control of the economy, and share things more equally. The goal of Marxism is to create a society where everyone is equal, and there’s no rich or poor. 

Sovietization stemmed from Marxism, as the Soviet Union attempted to put Marx’s ideas into practice by abolishing private property, redistributing wealth, and establishing a state-controlled economy in the name of equality and socialism.","EMPTY, USING OTHER ANS",

"lblPostWW2AnsPolLong","After World War II, Romania fell under heavy Soviet influence. Under Gheorghe Gherogiu-Dej, the country underwent a process of ‘Sovietization,’ which promoted Stalinist policies such as collectivization of agriculture and repression of any anti-ideology actions. 

However, in the 1960s, after the death of Joseph Stalin and the subsequent de-Stalinization under Khrushchev, Romania began to distance itself from the USSR’s direct control. While still maintaining a Marxist-Leninist political structure, Gheorgiu-Dej emphasized national sovereignty and pursued a more independent foreign policy. Romania improved its relations with neighboring socialist countries such as Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, and advocated for denuclearization and greater autonomy within the Eastern Bloc.","EMPTY, USING OTHER ANS",
