Under Ceau\u0219escu\u2019s rule, life became very difficult for Romanian citizens. There were severe food and energy shortages, and people had almost no freedom of speech or movement. A powerful secret police force called the Securitate spied on citizens, creating an atmosphere of fear and mistrust. Ceau\u0219escu also forced the country into huge construction projects, like the Palace of the Parliament in Bucharest \u2014one of the largest buildings in the world. These projects cost billions and were meant to show off his power, while most people lived in poverty and hardship. Today, Ceau\u0219escu is remembered as one of Europe\u2019s most repressive and controlling dictators.",

    "lblElenaAnsPolLong": "Elena Ceau\u0219escu was the wife of Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu, the dictator of communist Romania. Over time, she became one of the most powerful people in the country, even though she had little education and no real qualifications. Despite this, she was given high-ranking government positions, including Deputy Prime Minister and head of several scientific institutions. She was also president of Scientific Council of the Central Institute of Chemistry, but most of her academic titles and awards were fake or exaggerated. Her power came mainly from her close relationship with Nicolae as his \u201Cdirect correspondent,\u201D and she used it to promote herself and control others. Elena was known for being arrogant, strict, and deeply disliked by many Romanians. She was heavily involved in government decisions and is believed to have helped create the harsh policies that led to poverty, fear, and repression during the 1980s.",

During his time he tightened his grip on Romania due to his strict following of Marxism. He sought to distance Romania from the USSR after a high ranking Soviet Officer denounced the crimes Stalin had committed.

    "lblMarxismAnsPolLong": "Marxism is a way of thinking about society, economics, and politics that was created by Karl Marx. It is the idea that society is divided into two main groups: the rich (bourgeoisie) \u2013 who own businesses, land, and factories - and the working class (proletariat) \u2013 who work for the rich but don\u2019t own much themselves. Marx believed this wasn\u2019t fair and believed that the workers should come together, take control of the economy, and share things more equally. The goal of Marxism is to create a society where everyone is equal, and there\u2019s no rich or poor. \n\nSovietization stemmed from Marxism, as the Soviet Union attempted to put Marx\u2019s ideas into practice by abolishing private property, redistributing wealth, and establishing a state-controlled economy in the name of equality and socialism.",

Under Gheorghe Gherogiu-Dej, the country underwent a process of \u2018Sovietization,\u2019 which promoted Stalinist policies such as collectivization of agriculture and repression of any anti-ideology actions. \n\nHowever, in the 1960s, after the death of Joseph Stalin and the subsequent de-Stalinization under Khrushchev, Romania began to distance itself from the USSR\u2019s direct control. While still maintaining a Marxist-Leninist political structure, Gheorgiu-Dej emphasized national sovereignty and pursued a more independent foreign policy. Romania improved its relations with neighboring socialist countries such as Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, and advocated for denuclearization and greater autonomy within the Eastern Bloc.",
