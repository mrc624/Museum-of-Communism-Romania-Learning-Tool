Ceau\u0219escu wanted to control what people thought, said, and listened to.

    "lblWarsawAnsPolLong": "Romania joined the Warsaw Pact in 1955, as part of the bloc of states under the influence of the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Although Romania was officially a member of this military alliance dedicated to collective defense, its relationship with the organization was complex and nuanced.\nStarting in the 1960s, under the leadership of President Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu, Romania began to adopt a relatively independent foreign policy from Moscow. This trend toward autonomy was reflected in diplomatic and strategic decisions that sometimes went against the directions imposed by the Soviet bloc. A notable example was Romania\u2019s refusal to participate in the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, highlighting a more independent stance toward communist military policies.\nThus, although Romania benefited from the military and political support provided by the USSR through the Warsaw Pact, the country sought to maintain a certain level of autonomy in its external and internal decisions. After the fall of communist regimes and the dissolution of the pact, Romania shifted its foreign policy toward integration into Western structures, later joining NATO and the European Union.",

    "lblAnaAnsPolLong": "The Romanian Communist Party was founded on May 8th, 1921. After World War II, the party was influenced by the Soviet Union and its leader, Joseph Stalin. The communists slowly took control by using propaganda and taking advantage of other political parties\u2019 weaknesses. Communism officially started in Romania in 1947, when King Michael I was forced to give up the throne and the country became a communist republic.\nAna Pauker was an intellectual and was the unofficial prime minister of Romania\u0027s communist party after WWII. She was a strong believer in Stalinist ideology, a totalitarian political regime lead by Joseph Stalin. The main policies of his regime were rapid induztrialization, cultural revolution, and a reorginization of agricultural output.\nWhile she supported Stalinism, she did not believe in the reorganization of all industries for governmental control and did allow for emigration of the Jewish population - something not seen in other communist leaders at the time. Pauker was the first woman to hold such a position in the Communist Party. In 1952, she was ousted of her position by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and was placed under arrest as a result due to the political risk she posed to Gheorghiu-Dej.",

Over 1,000 people were killed and thousands more were injured during the clashes. Eventually, the pressure became too much for the Securitate.

At first he had a lot of support due to his public criticism of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Prague in 1968. This public reaction created the image of a dissident political leader within the satellite states, which generated the political and economic rise of Romania in relation to the Western states. However, over time, he became more authoritarian \u2014 he demanded total control and removed from party structures any voice opposing his ideas. Under the leadership of the Ceau\u0219escu family, life became very difficult for citizens. There were severe shortages of food and energy, and people had almost no freedom of expression and did not benefit from basic human rights. A powerful secret police force called the Securitate spied on citizens, creating an atmosphere of fear and mistrust. Ceau\u0219escu forced the country\u0027s development into huge construction projects, such as the People\u0027s House in Bucharest, which is one of the largest government buildings in the world.

Marx believed this wasn\u2019t fair and believed that the workers should come together, take control of the economy, and share things more equally. The goal of Marxism is to create a society where everyone is equal, and there\u2019s no rich or poor. \nSovietization stemmed from Marxism, as the Soviet Union attempted to put Marx\u2019s ideas into practice by abolishing private property, redistributing wealth, and establishing a state-controlled economy in the name of equality and socialism.",
